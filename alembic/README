# TODO
services from goodtherapy should be parsed in the same way as modality

credentials finds modalities, add them to the user record

school/year graduated should ONLY come from the NYDB

payor_id = whether or not that person showed up in the payor scrape
accepted_payors = comes from PT, GT, so remove

payor_id -> verified_payors
accepted_payors -> self_reported_payors


certificate_number = ABPN only
certified = whether or not that cert number is currently valid
